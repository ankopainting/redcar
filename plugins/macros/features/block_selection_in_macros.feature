#Feature: Block selection in macros
#  The macros should behave correctly around block selection mode.
#
#  Background:
#    When I open a new edit tab
#    Given the content is:
#        """
#        foo
#        bar
#        baz
#        """
#    And I move to the start of the text
#    
#  Scenario: Set the correct block selection mode before running the macro
#    When I turn block selection on
#    And I start recording a macro
#    And I select down
#    And I select down
#    And I type "a"
#    And I stop recording a macro
#    And I turn block selection off
#    And I move to the start of the text
#    And I run the last recorded macro
#    Then the content should be:
#        """
#        aafoo
#        aabar
#        aabaz
#        """
#        
#  Scenario: Change block selection mode during the macro
#    And I start recording a macro
#    When I turn block selection on
#    And I select down
#    And I select down
#    And I type "a"
#    And I stop recording a macro
#    And I turn block selection off
#    And I move to the start of the text
#    And I run the last recorded macro
#    Then the content should be:
#        """
#        aafoo
#        aabar
#        aabaz
#        """
