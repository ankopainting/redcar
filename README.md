## INSTALLING FROM SOURCE

If you want to contribute to Redcar, you can install it from the source code.

If you're running Windows, as a prerequisite, you'll need to install the rubyzip gem:

    $ gem install rubyzip

Download from github, checkout the submodules and install the jars.

    $ git clone git://github.com/redcar/redcar.git
    $ cd redcar
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    $ ruby bin/redcar install

To run:

    $ ruby bin/redcar

## UPDATING A SOURCE BUILD

If you are running a source version of Redcar and you have pulled changes from master, then you may have to update your repo:

    $ git submodule update
    $ ruby bin/redcar install

## TESTS

NB. Redcar features are known to work with Cucumber 0.9.2, and known NOT to work with Cucumber < 0.9

To run the tests you need JRuby installed. You also need rspec and cucumber installed as Jruby gems. See jruby.org for this, or install with rvm.

To run all specs and features:

    $ jruby -S rake

NB. You must leave the test window focussed while the features run. Some of the tests will fail if the test process is in the background.
